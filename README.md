# stickysnippets
<h4>
I made Sticky Snippets because i opened up the windows sticky note application and realized you couldn't save your notes to a file.
</h4>
With this application, you can save to a file with whatever extension you'd like and everyone could use it (Linux, Mac & Windows).

Also you could write a little script in your language of choice, save with the extension of your choosing and run later. 
This also works well with code snippets.
