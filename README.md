# stickysnippets
<h3>
I made Sticky Snippets because when I opened the Windows Sticky Note application I realized you couldn't save your notes to a file.<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Also you could write a little script in your language of choice, save with the extension of your choosing and run later.<br>
</h4>
<h4>
This also works well with code snippets.<br>
</h4>
<h4>
With this application, you can save to a file with whatever extension you'd like and everyone could use it (Linux, Mac & Windows).<br>
