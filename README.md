# stickysnippets

## I made Sticky Snippets because when I opened the Windows Sticky Note application I realized you couldn't save your notes to a file.<br>


### In this application you can write a simple to-do list or a write a little script in your language of choice, save with the extension of your choosing and run later.<br>

### This also works well with code snippets.
#### With this application, you can save to a file with whatever extension you'd like and everyone could use it (Linux, Mac & Windows).<br>
